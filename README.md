The objective of this project is to apply the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) machine learning algorithm to classify breast cancer data into benign or malignant categories. By utilizing the provided training and testing datasets, the project involves preprocessing the data, training the kNN model, optimizing the number of neighbors using GridSearchCV, and evaluating the modelâ€™s performance through accuracy calculations and visualizations such as confusion matrices and accuracy plots. The key libraries used in this project include Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations, and Scikit-learn for implementing the kNN algorithm, model optimization, and performance evaluation, with optional use of StandardScaler to standardize the data for improved results.
